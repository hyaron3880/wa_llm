What is the intent of the message? What does the user want us to help with?
The message may be in Hebrew. Understand the intent regardless of language.

Guidelines for classification:
- Requests to summarize TODAY's chat → summarize
- Questions about the bot itself or its capabilities → about
- Everything else → ask_question (general knowledge, weather, news, URLs, time/date, casual chat, jokes, opinions, greetings, creative requests, etc.)

Almost NEVER use "other". Only use it for completely empty or unintelligible gibberish.
